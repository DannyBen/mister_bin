Examples
==================================================

Each example folder contains a self-contained, documented ruby file that 
demonstrates one or more aspects of Mister Bin.

To run it, simply execute it from inside each example directory:

```shell
$ cd 01-minimal
$ ./app.rb
```

Note that in a real life setup, each example file will be distributed among
several files (for example, each class in a file of its own).
