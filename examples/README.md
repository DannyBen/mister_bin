Examples
==================================================

Each example folder contains a self-contained ruby file, and a `runme` script
that will execute several commands for example.

To run it, simply execute either of the files:

```shell
$ cd 01-minimal
$ ./app.rb
# ... or ...
$ ./runme
```

Note that in a real life setup, each example file will be distributed among
several files (for example, each class in a file of its own).
